# 110. Balanced Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, determine if it is **height-balanced**.

A **height-balanced** binary tree is a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than 1.

## Example 1:

![Balanced Binary Tree](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/06/balance_1.jpg)

**Input:**  
root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]  
**Output:** true

## Example 2:

![Unbalanced Binary Tree](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2020/10/06/balance_2.jpg)

**Input:**  
root = [1,2,2,3,3,null,null,4,4]  
**Output:** false

## Example 3:

**Input:**  
root = []  
**Output:** true

## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 5000]`.
- `-10^4 <= Node.val <= 10^4`
